        <li>Rock sugar</li>
        <li>1.5lbs pork ribs, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>30 dried chilies</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the chili paste ingredients with a mini food processor until finely ground and well blended. Heat up the wok and add cooking oil. Stir fry the chili paste for 5 minutes. Dish up and set aside.</li>
        <li>On the same wok unwashed, add in a little oil and cook the shrimp topping. Add in a little chili paste, sugar, and salt. Pan-fried the shrimp until they are slightly burned. Dish out, let cool, and sliced them into halves.</li>
        <li>Add 15 cups of water into a pot and bring it to bowl. Add in all the shrimp heads and shell and simmer on low heat for about 2 hours or longer until the stock becomes cloudy and tastes really prawny.</li>
        <li>Strain the stock through a sieve and transfer the stock into another pot. Discard the shrimp heads and shells. Scoop up and discard the orange "foam" forming at the top of the stock.</li>
        <li>Bring the stock to boil again and add in half of the chili paste. You can add more chili paste if you like it spicier.</li>
        <li>Add in the pork ribs and continue to boil in low heat for another 1-1.5 hour until the pork ribs are thoroughly cooked.</li>
        <li>Add rock sugar and salt to taste.</li>
        <li>To serve, place a portion of yellow noodles, rice vermicelli, water convolvulus and bean sprouts in a bowl. Ladle hot stock over. If desired, add a few pieces of pork ribs. Top with sliced pork meat, sliced shrimp, egg quarters, and sprinkle with shallot crisps.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with more chili paste to taste.</li>
    </ol>
